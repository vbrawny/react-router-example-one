# react-router-example-one

we wanted to implement routing -

ourdomain.com/ - default page - component 1

ourdomain.com/products - products page - component 2

ourdomain.com/cart - carts page - component 3

So we need to setup Routing.

ourdomain.com/product-detail/<anything/p1/p2/> - dynamic segement routing
